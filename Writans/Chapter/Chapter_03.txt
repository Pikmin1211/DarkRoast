[MidLeft][LoadFlor][MidRight][LoadOlmos]
[MidRight]
Flor, what's this town[N]
coming into view?[AN]
I don't recall there being[N]
any other ports here.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's an old port.[N]
No longer in use.[AN]
When our ancestors first came[N]
to the island of Tomelloso,[AN]
they didn't all settle in the[N]
same cities and towns we have today.[AN]
Some of these settlements were[N]
abandoned over the course of history.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm surprised that anyone would spend[N]
time building something only to leave it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You could ask our ancestors why they[N]
came to this land at all.[AN]
Did they not have lives they built[N]
in the old country, too?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, yes, I'm sure, but-[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Regardless, my guess is that this port[N]
was likely built long ago.[AN]
This is likely when House Poblano was[N]
a colony of the old country.[AN]
Much of the infrastructure built at[N]
the time was to support exports.[AN]
Once the Tomelloseros banded together[N]
to create a unified and free kingdom,[AN]
many left these ports behind.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, I recall the lessons on the[N]
Tomelloseros Revolution, thank you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then you'd know during the war[N]
that many towns were fit with[AN]
different defense mechanisms to protect[N]
supplies and make landing difficult.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes. I recall reading about locking[N]
mechanisms to store food and arms.[AN]
Are you suggesting this port may be[N]
fit with some of these?[AN]
[MidLeft]
They very well could be.[AN]
[MidRight]
In La Paz, during my studies,[N]
we did visit some old battle sites.[AN]
I'm curious if the techniques used[N]
were the same on this side of the island.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you may just get your chance.[N]
But first, we should-[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
Hail, Lord Olmos![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_2
[Left][LoadUsoa][FarLeft][LoadErlantz][Right][LoadOlmos][FarRight][LoadFlor]
[Left]
Lord Olmos![N]
I'm glad we caught up with you.[AN]
[Right]
Dame Usoa? Did my brother[N]
send you here?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, he did. When Lord Aquino[N]
received word from you of your task,[AN]
he sent the four of us, saying[N]
"bolster my brother in battle.[AN]
Protect him with your very life."[N]
We were happy to oblige.[AN]
[Right]
He'd part with such talented soldiers[Beat][N]
Does he not think me-[AN]
No, mustn't entertain the thought.[N]
Erm, thank you, Dame Usoa.[AN]
[Left]
It's simply our duty, Lord Olmos.[N]
Think nothing of it.[AN]
[FarRight]
We're grateful, Usoa.[N]
Your husband is here, too?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yes, yes, rare to see me[N]
away from the stables, I know.[AN]
[Left]
Erlantz couldn't bear parting with me,[N]
even after all these years![AN]
I had thought he loved his horses[N]
more than me![AN]
[FarLeft]
You're always so self-conscious.[N] 
My dear, I go where you go.[AN]
Lord Olmos, I trust my staff[N]
will serve you well.[AN]
[Right]
Of that I have no doubt.[N]
Many thanks, Erlantz.[AN]
Who else is in your retinue,[N]
Dame Usoa?[AN]
[Left]
Mm, they should introduce themselves.[N]
Robles! Itzel![AN]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear][Left][LoadRobles][FarLeft][LoadItzel]
[Left]
I am Robles, Lord Olmos.[N]
In my youth, I was an apprentice chef.[AN]
My brother was a sailor,[N][CloseEyes]
and when he perished at sea[Beat][AN]
I only wish I could've been there[N]
to protect him myself.[AN][OpenEyes]
It was then I tossed my knife aside,[N]
and instead reached for my blade![AN]
So now, I hope to avenge him,[N]
and oust these foul-[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
Robles![AN]
[Left]
Ah, pardon me, milord.[N]
I spoke out of turn.[AN]
May my shield protect you.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat] Think nothing of it.[N]
I'm glad to have you.[AN]
And who is the young rider?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] I'm Itzel, milord.[N]
I'm a new recruit[Beat][AN]
[Left]
You've proven yourself an adept[N]
equestrian, Itzel.[AN]
In no time, you'll be a full-[N]
fledged knight![AN]
[FarLeft]
Ah[Beat] you're too kind.[AN]
[Right]
Welcome. We're glad to have you[N]
in our growing band.[AN]
Come now, we're making our[N]
way to the port.[A][X]
