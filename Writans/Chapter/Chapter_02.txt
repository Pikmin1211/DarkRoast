[OpenMidLeft]
It's been a quiet journey so far[N]
hasn't it, Flor?[AN]
I'm not sure if I should feel relieved[N]
or worried that it's been so silent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We've mostly been moving through[N]
farmland reserved for coffee production.[AN]
I'm starting to see more diverse crops.[N]
We should be nearing a village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm?[N]
I fail to see the connection.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The people cannot eat coffee, Lord Olmos.[N]
While it is highly lucrative overseas,[AN]
it isn't going to feed your family.[AN]
Most of the farmland in the Poblano region[N]
is used for coffee cultivation and export.[AN]
Most domestic food production is localized.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[AN]
I didn't realize you knew so much[N]
about the economy and farming, Flor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm surprised you don't know more.[N]
Your family is in charge of all of this, you know.[AN]
Almost all of the gold that flows[N]
into the island comes from this one crop.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Which is why keeping pirates at bay[N]
is an important part of a lord's duties, no?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[AN]
Another part of your duties is meeting[N]
with those you're sworn to protect.[AN]
The village is coming into view.[N]
We should stop and pay them our respects.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed, let's go.[A][X]

[OpenRight]
Ah, is this the young Lord Olmos?[N]
It is truly an honor.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you, sir.[N]
No need to be so formal.[AN]
We are passing through and saw it[N]
fit to pay our respects.[AN]
Are you the keeper of the village shrine?[A]
[OpenRight]
That's right.[N]
I am Father Domingo.[AN]
This is my assistant, Sister Luz.[N]
We tend to the shrines in this village.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
You flatter me, Father Domgino.[N]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenRight]
Sister Luz was selected to be the next[N]
shaman of this shrine.[AN]
Soon, she will hear the voice of Recaudo.[N]
Many years passed since one heard the call[Beat][A]
[OpenLeft]
The call?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Throughout the island some hear the call[N]
of the spirits of the shrines[Beat][AN]
I first heard the call years ago,[N]
and will fulfill an acceptance ceremony[AN]
when the time is right.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I see[Beat][N]
So, you will be Recaudo's voice?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
That's correct.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
We'd like to make an offering[N]
and rest for a short while.[AN]
We're on important business[N]
and heading towards the eastern coast.[A]
[OpenRight]
But of course, of course.[N]
Right this way.[A][X]

[OpenRight]
O Recaudo, protector of this village,[N]
keep watch over these brave soldiers,[AN]
for it is they who protect this village[N]
and the blessed crops of Qahweh safe.[AN]
We humbly ask you accept these offerings[N]
as thanks for serving as our shield.[AN]
We are grateful for your continued[N]
guidance, goddess Recaudo![AN][OpenRight][OpenEyes][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you, Father Domingo.[N]
You are most kind.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Your offering is most generous.[AN]
I'm sure the goddess will be pleased[N]
and continue to watch over you.[AN]
[OpenRight]
As long as we pay respects,[N]
we will not be abandoned.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[OpenLeft]
I understand for centuries now that we've[N]
paid our respects to these spirits,[AN]
so that we may be protected from worldly[N]
pain and malevolent spirits.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Indeed.[N]
The people of Tomelloso are a spiritual one,[AN]
for many claim the opportunities they have[N]
are owed to them by divinity.[AN]
When our ancestors first arrived to this island,[N]
many of us were desperately poor.[AN]
When coffee was discovered and prized,[N]
the legend of Qahweh grew.[AN]
The legends of other gods, spirits,[N]
saints, and other figures grew, too,[AN]
to help make sense of the good fortune[N]
the people here had found.[AN]
Recaudo is said to have been the founder[N]
of our village, Habanero,[AN]
having staved off attacks from fierce[N]
pirates by herself.[AN]
Her prowess in battle and dedication to[N]
us is why we owe her our respect.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
While we tend to shrines of Qahweh and[N]
other benevolent figures,[AN]
Recaudo is who we feel most indebted to.[N]
If we give her our devotion,[AN]
she will return it in kind.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Indeed, Sister Luz.[AN]
But we should not bore our guests[N]
with stories of ancient lore.[AN]
Lord Olmos, would you and your cadre[N]
care for a coffee?[AN]
It would be our honor to serve you.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
While your offer is most generous,[N]
Father Domingo, I'm afraid-[AN]
[OpenLeft]
We'd be happy to, Father Domingo.[N]
Thank you for your hospitality.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Splendid. I shall see it done.[N]
With me, Sister Luz.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Help! P-pirates![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
They're attacking the town![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat]Our coffee will need to wait.[N]
Lord Olmos, your orders?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Father Domingo, Sister Luz, we'll handle this.[AN]
Please make sure the villagers are[N]
able to hide.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Nonsense.[AN]
What sort of shrine keeper would I be if[N]
I was not willing to die protecting it?[AN]
We will fight alongside you, Lord Olmos.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes. Allow us to heal your wounded.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Are you certain? I mean-[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
There's no time, Lord Olmos,[N]
we must make our move.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Right.[N]
Everyone! Get in position![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Post_Prep

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
We cannot let the shrine be destroyed.[AN]
You may think it silly,[N]
but the loss of morale would be too great.[AN]
Please[Beat], we must protect the shrine[N]
at all costs.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Intro

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerez]
The harvest should've just come in![N]
Take whatever you can carry.[AN]
Those shrine keepers won't be able[N]
to stop us![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit]
Perez! Lord Olmos is here![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What!? The Baron's son?[N]
This should be good fortune.[AN]
Olmos is but a tender calf[N]
waiting for the slaughter.[AN]
His life will be worth much more[N]
than the crops we came for.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you propose we change our plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There's no need to deviate from the plan.[N]
Idiot![AN]
This is a golden opportunity![AN]
That wench Fideos will be kowtowing[N]
to me in due time![AN]
Capture Lord Olmos,[N]
kill everyone else![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Boss![A][X]

## Chapter_02_SysText_Opening

Protect the shrine. If the shrine's[N]
HP falls to zero, you will receive[N]
a game over.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Charge

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerez]
That's it! I've had enough of this[N]
game of cat and mouse![AN]
We're deciding this here and now![N]
Everyone! Rush in! Kill them all![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Top_Left_Village

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOldMan]
I toiled for many years on[N]
the coffee farms of Baron Colome.[AN]
So did my father, and my father's[N]
father before him. We all did.[AN]
Before my father's father before[N]
him, we lived in the old country.[AN]
My guess is that we toiled there, too.[N]
It never stops.[AN]
After many generations, I can only[N]
hope my grandson escapes this cruel cycle.[AN]
He's a smart lad, but still naive.[N]
He's a mercenary now.[AN]
You remind me of him a bit.[N]
Here, take this.[AN]
This axe is heavy, but packs a[N]
mean wallop. Use it well.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Bottom_Left_Village

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadDarkHairWoman]
I was training to become a maiden[N]
of the shrine with Father Domingo,[AN]
but the pay wasn't enough.[N]
I then wanted to take up medicine,[AN]
but my family is too poor to[N]
send me to the capital for school.[AN]
I run a small coffee shop now.[N]
Locally roasted here in town.[AN]
Qahweh was kind enough to bless me[N]
with the skill of coffee brewing.[AN]
It's not easy, but we get by.[N]
Here, you're out there protecting us.[AN]
I learned this staff some time ago,[N]
but don't have much use for it now.[AN]
Take it, and may the goddess Recaudo[N]
protect you.[A][X]


## Chapter_02_Top_Right_Village

[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOrangeHairMan]
I was a town guard for a few years.[N]
It beat wasting away in the coffee fields.[AN]
After a scrap with a few brigands,[N]
I hurt my back beyond repair.[AN]
Still need to make coin for the folks,[N]
so I tried learning to sew.[AN]
I've gotten pretty good at it.[N]
Can make some nice scarves, even.[AN]
No matter how beat up my body gets,[N]
I still need to work.[AN]
That's just life around these parts.[N]
Nothing comes to you for free.[AN]
I know fighting ain't easy.[N]
Here, take my old spear.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Quote

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
I'll do this myself![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Death

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
Guooghh[Beat] Fideos[Beat][N]
I'll best you[Beat] yet[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_02_Ending_1

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor][OpenLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenRight][LoadDomingo][OpenFarRight][LoadLuz]
[OpenRight]
Lord Olmos, Lady Flor[Beat][N]
Thank you for helping us.[AN]
The village and the shrine[N]
survived the onslaught.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I'm glad we were able to stop them.[N]
I won't let pirates plague our lands.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Lord Olmos, we should keep moving.[N]
I can smell the ocean on the corpses.[AN]
We should be able to find[N]
their base. We should move soon.[A]
[OpenRight]
Before you go, you must spend the night.[N]
Soldiers you may be,[AN]
but a weary soul leaves[N]
the body vulnerable.[AN]
I strongly encourage you all[N]
to spend the night here.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes, the townsfolk are certainly[N]
indebted to you.[AN]
I can make the arrangements.[N]
[Beat] This is what Recaudo would want.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Look, that's nice of you,[N]
but we cannot dally for long.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Come now, Flor.[N]
It'd be rude to reject such an offer.[AN]
One night's rest would do us well.[N]
Thank you both. We accept.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat] Very well.[A]
[OpenRight]
Splendid.[N]
Now then, one final order of business.[AN]
Sister Luz.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes, Father Domingo?[A]
[OpenRight]
You are still training to be[N]
the next shaman.[AN]
It may do you well to travel[N]
with Lord Olmos for a time.[AN]
Expand your horizons beyond[N]
the walls of this small town.[AN]
In fact, I know it would do me[N]
well, too. It's been many years[AN]
since I last felt new grass[N]
beneath my feet.[AN]
Lord Olmos, will you allow us[N]
to travel with you?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Father Domingo[Beat][N]
Should we? Is it wise?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
I have no objections.[N]
I trust Flor does not, either?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
None at all. They've proven themselves[N]
on the battlefield.[AN]
No soldier would reject[N]
the support of a healer, after all.[A]
[OpenRight]
Excellent. Most excellent.[N]
Gwahaha![AN]
I've felt a spark I have not felt[N]
in many years.[AN]
Truly, our meeting is most fortuitous![N]
Let us celebrate first,[AN]
then rest in preparation for[N]
the journey tomorrow.[A]
[OpenLeft]
The journey[Beat][N]
Yes, let's work together.[AN]
Thank you, Father Domingo.[A][X]
