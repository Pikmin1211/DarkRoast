[OpenMidLeft]
It's been a quiet journey so far[N]
hasn't it, Flor?[AN]
I'm not sure if I should feel relieved[N]
or worried that it's been so silent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We've mostly been moving through[N]
farmland reserved for coffee production.[AN]
I'm starting to see more diverse crops.[N]
We should be nearing a village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm?[N]
I fail to see the connection.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The people cannot eat coffee, Lord Olmos.[N]
While it is highly lucrative overseas,[AN]
it isn't going to feed your family.[AN]
Most of the farmland in the Poblano region[N]
is used for coffee cultivation and export.[AN]
Most domestic food production is localized.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[AN]
I didn't realize you knew so much[N]
about the economy and farming, Flor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm surprised you don't know more.[N]
Your family is in charge of all of this, you know.[AN]
Almost all of the gold that flows[N]
into the island comes from this one crop.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Which is why keeping pirates at bay[N]
is an important part of a lord's duties, no?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[AN]
Another part of your duties is meeting[N]
with those you're sworn to protect.[AN]
The village is coming into view.[N]
We should stop and pay them our respects.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed, let's go.[A][X]

[OpenRight]
Ah, is this the young Lord Olmos?[N]
It is truly an honor.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you, sir.[N]
No need to be so formal.[AN]
We are passing through and saw it[N]
fit to pay our respects.[AN]
Are you the keeper of the village shrine?[A]
[OpenRight]
That's right.[N]
I am Father Domingo.[AN]
This is my assistant, Sister Luz.[N]
We tend to the shrines in this village.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
You flatter me, Father Domgino.[N]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenRight]
Sister Luz was selected to be the next[N]
shaman of this shrine.[AN]
Soon, she will hear the voice of Recaudo.[N]
Many years passed since one heard the call[Beat][A]
[OpenLeft]
The call?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Throughout the island some hear the call[N]
of the gods and goddesses of the shrines[Beat][AN]
I first heard the call years ago,[N]
and will fulfill an acceptance ceremony[AN]
when the time is right.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I see[Beat][N]
So, you will be Recaudo's voice?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
That's correct.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
We'd like to make an offering[N]
and rest for a short while.[AN]
We're on important business[N]
and heading towards the eastern coast.[A]
[OpenRight]
But of course, of course.[N]
Right this way.[A]

[OpenRight]
O Recaudo, protector of this village,[N]
keep watch over these brave soldiers,[AN]
for it is they who protect this village[N]
and the blessings of Qahweh safe.[AN]
Please accept these offerings from[N]
House Poblano, and keep us safe.[AN]
We are grateful for your continued[N]
guidance, goddess Recaudo![AN][OpenRight][OpenEyes][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you, Father Domingo.[N]
You are most kind.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Your offering is most generous, Lord Olmos.[AN]
I'm sure the goddess will be pleased[N]
and continue to watch over you.[AN]
[OpenRight]
As long as we pay respects,[N]
we will not be abandoned.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[OpenLeft]
I understand for centuries now that we've[N]
paid our respects to the gods,[AN]
so that we may be protected from worldly[N]
pain and malevolent spirits.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Indeed.[N]
The people of Tomelloso are a spiritual one,[AN]
for many claim the opportunities they have[N]
are owed to them by divinity.[AN]
When our ancestors first arrived to this island,[N]
many of us were desperately poor.[AN]
When coffee was discovered and prized,[N]
the legend of Qahweh grew.[AN]
The legends of other gods, spirits,[N]
saints, and other figures grew, too,[AN]
to help make sense of the good fortune[N]
the people here had found.[AN]
Recaudo is said to have been the founder[N]
of our village, Habanero,[AN]
having staved off attacks from fierce[N]
pirates by herself.[AN]
Her prowess in battle and dedication to[N]
the people is why we still pay our respects to her.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
While we tend to shrines of Qahweh and[N]
other benevolent figures,[AN]
Recaudo is who we feel most indebted to.[N]
If we give her our devotion,[AN]
she will return it in kind.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Indeed, Sister Luz.[AN]
But we should not bore our guests[N]
with stories of ancient lore.[AN]
Lord Olmos, would you and your cadre[N]
care for a coffee?[AN]
It would be our honor to serve you.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
While your offer is most generous,[N]
Father Domingo, I'm afraid-[AN]
[OpenLeft]
We'd be happy to, Father Domingo.[N]
Thank you for your hospitality.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Splendid. I shall see it done.[N]
With me, Sister Luz.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Help! P-pirates![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
They're attacking the town![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat]Our coffee will need to wait.[N]
Lord Olmos, your orders?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Father Domingo, Sister Luz, we'll handle this.[AN]
Please make sure the villagers are[N]
able to hide.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Nonsense.[AN]
What sort of shrine keeper would I be[N]
if not one who was willing to die protecting it?[AN]
We will fight alongside you, Lord Olmos.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes. Allow us to heal your wounded.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Are you certain? I mean-[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
There's no time, Lord Olmos,[N]
we must make our move.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Right.[N]
Everyone! Get in position![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Post_Prep

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
We cannot let the shrine be destroyed.[AN]
You may think it silly,[N]
but the loss of morale would be too great.[AN]
Please[Beat], we must protect the shrine[N]
at all costs.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Intro

[OpenMidRight][LoadPerez]
The harvest should've just come in![N]
Take whatever you can carry.[AN]
Those shrine keepers won't be able[N]
to stop us![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit]
Perez! Lord Olmos is here![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What!? The Baron's son?[N]
This should be good fortune.[AN]
Olmos is but a tender calf[N]
waiting for the slaughter.[AN]
His life will be worth much more[N]
than the crops we came for.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you propose we change our plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There's no need to deviate from the plan.[N]
Idiot![AN]
This is a golden opportunity![AN]
That wench Fideos will be kowtowing[N]
to me in due time![AN]
Capture Lord Olmos, kill everyone else![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Boss![A][X]

## Chapter_02_SysText_Opening

Protect the shrine. If the shrine's[N]
HP falls to zero, you will receive[N]
a game over.[A][X]
