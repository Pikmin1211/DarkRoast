My mother says that the pirates have been causing a ruckus for a while. They like to steal coffee beans and sell them overseas[Beat] I don't get why all of you adults go so crazy for it. It isn't even good unless you pour a lot of sugar in it. Anyway, if you're fighting the pirates, this may be helpful.
