Fatigue simulates unit tiredness.[N]
If a unit's fatigue exceeds their[N]
HP, they will no longer gain EXP[N]
or WEXP on the map. They must sit[N]
out for the next chapter as well.[N]
Benching a unit for 1 chapter will[N]
reset their fatigue to 0.[N]
[N]
Fatigue builds for each action[N]
a unit takes. This includes[N]
combat (both on player[N]
and enemy phase), using a staff,[N]
or shoving. Each[N]
unit gains 1 fatigue per action.[X]
