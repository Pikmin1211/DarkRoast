Fatigue simulates unit tiredness.[N]
If a unit's fatigue exceeds their[N]
HP, they will no longer gain EXP[N]

sit out for the next chapter.[N]

reset their fatigue to 0.[N]
[N]
Fatigue builds for each action[N]
a unit takes. This includes[N]
combat (both on player[N]
and enemy phase), using a staff,[N]
shoving, or rescuing. Each[N]
unit gains 1 fatigue per action.[X]
