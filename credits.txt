INSPIRATIONS / Special Thanks
----
Listing some key inspirations here that helped shape direction of the project across its story, map objectives, item design, mechanic design, sound direction, and visual direction. While I take inspiration from many sources, I wanted to list those that have been major touchstones throughout development.

Hacks --

Road to Ruin - PrimeFusion
Dream of Five - AstraLunaSol
Souls of the Forest - Scraiza
The Last Promise - Blazer
Sword of Heaven & Earth - 38%
FE7x - BwdYeti
Call of the Armor - Team Distant Roads (& other projects) // I know crediting myself is weird but I only made 2/20ths of it.
Iron Emblem - MournfulRelic // Relic did all of the work here, I only made a few maps

And the vanilla FE I borrowed most heavily from --

Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon // Numbers, unit design, cast design
Fire Emblem Gaiden // Shrines, statboost design, the vibes
Fire Emblem Thracia 776 // Fatigue
Fire Emblem Fates // EXP

And lastly, other media --

Romance of the Three Kingdoms // Plot elements
Tales of Symphonia // the vibes
Super Mario Sunshine // Location design
Shenmue // Interlude stuff
